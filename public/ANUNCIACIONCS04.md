### **A. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.**

#### 1.) Javascript Operations (not all)
###### This lesson is the basis of CS Quarter 1. It gives the structure of all the codes, basic and advanced. Without learning this lesson, coding using Javascript would be harder. 

#### 2.) Variable Declaration
###### Variable Declaration is used as something to hold or store data. In declaring a variable, you need to give and specify the type of variable it is, giving it a name, and assigning it and giving a value.

#### 3.) Javascript Basic Statements
###### This lesson is essential to produce some basic bodies of code. They are the instructions that the script performs and executes to do specific actions. 

#### 4.) if else Statements
###### if else Statements is an important part of programming. It helps control certain variables and also the control and flow of the entire script by making differing decisions and outputs each time.

#### 5.) Declaring Funtions
##### This is a useful lesson to learn as it can produce different outcomes to different or same situations. Each function has a different syntax and can be paired with a different statement to give out a different output.

### **B. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.** 
##### 1.) Loop Control Structures - Programming constructs that give repeated executions of a specific instruction. It was hard to understand how to successfully perform one.
##### 2.) Event Handlers - Executed in response to specific events. It's difficult to understand how to do one.
##### 3.) Comparison Operators - Used to compare two values to one another. I need more practice as sometimes I dont know when to use them. 
##### 4.) Arithmetic Operators - Used as an addition operator for numeric values. Like the first operator, I sometimes dont know when to use them. 
##### 5.) Input and Output Functions - Allows data to be recieved and processed. Sometimes the script line would be a bit long and I lose track on what I am supposed to do.

### **C. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**
##### I plan to practice more for future tasks, actually attempt to understand the topic, and repeatedly do personal coding tasks to help me.

### **D. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
##### The Kahoot and in-person Coding tasks seemed to help me more as both my classmates and teacher were there in the times I needed help. The homework and home coding tasks were least effective as no one was there to assist me in case I did something wrong in the code, in which some cases I did and recieved a lower mark than I would like.
